# Instructions

# To use this file either copy it to ~/.procmailrc or use INCLUDERC to load it.
# Read the procmail, procmailrc, procmailex and procmailsc for more
# information.

# Configuration

# This files assumes that you are using standard mailbox file format to save
# your mail. You may change the directories that these variables point to, but
# the directories exist for this rcfile to function correctly.

#MAILDIR=~/Mail				# Uncomment if in needed
DEBIAN=debian				# Directory for debian mailing lists
DC_INSTALLER=$DEBIAN/installer		# New Debian Packages directory
DC_DIR=$DEBIAN/changes-other		# Directory for debian-changes
DDC_DIR=$DEBIAN/devel-changes-other	# Directory for debian-devel-changes

# These variables are used to control the sorting of the debian-changes and
# debian-devel-changes list. It is likely that you will want to change them.

ARCHS=alpha|arm|m68k|powerpc|sparc	# Archs that do not interest me
PACKAGES=colortail|esh|vh|x2vnc|sniffit	# Packages on other archs of interest

# The Debian changes and Debian development changes mailing lists are special
# cases. Architectures that are not of any real interest, specified using the
# $ARCHS variable are separated out into mailboxes named after the
# architectures. They are stored in the directory specified by $DC_DIR for the
# Debian changes mailing lists and $DDC_DIR for the Debian development changes
# mailing lists.
#
# However the uploads and installs of some packages on all architectures may
# be of interest. These pacakges can be specified using the $PACAKGES
# variable. I use it for the packages I maintain so I can see when they have
# been built on other architectures.
#
# Note: See the master.procmail script if you are short of bandwidth and do
# not want these messages to even reach your machine. If master.procmail is in
# use the recipes should never be true, unless the $PACKAGES and $ARCHS
# variables are different on master than locally.
