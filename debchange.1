.SH NAME
debchange \- Tool for maintenance of the debian/changelog file in a source package
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdebchange\fR [\fIoptions\fR] [\fItext\fR ...]
.br
\fBdch\fR [\fIoptions\fR] [\fItext\fR ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdebchange\fR or its alias \fBdch\fR will add a new comment line to
the Debian changelog in the current source tree.  This command must be
run from within that tree.  If the text of the change is given on the
commandline, \fBdebchange\fR will run in batch mode and simply add the
text, with line breaks as necessary, at the appropriate place in
\fIdebian/changelog\fR (or the changelog specified by options, as
described below).  If no text is specified then \fBdebchange\fR
will run the editor as determined by \fBsensible-editor\fR for you to
edit the file.  (The environment variables \fBVISUAL\fR and
\fBEDITOR\fR are used in this order to determine which editor to use.)
Editors which understand the \fI+n\fR option for starting the editing
on a specified line will use this to move to the correct line of the
file for editing.  If the editor is quit without modifying the
temporary file, \fBdebchange\fR will exit without touching the
existing changelog.  \fBNote that the changelog is assumed to be
encoded with the UTF-8 encoding.  If it is not, problems may occur.\fR
Please see the \fBiconv\fR(1) manpage to find out how to convert
changelogs from legacy encodings.
.PP
\fBdebchange\fR also supports automatically producing bug-closing
changelog entries, using the \fB\-\-closes\fR option.  This will
usually query the BTS, the Debian Bug Tracking System (see
http://bugs.debian.org/) to determine the title of the bug and the
package in which it occurs.  This behaviour can be stopped by giving a
\fB\-\-noquery\fR option or by setting the configuration variable
\fBDEBCHANGE_QUERY_BTS\fR to \fIno\fR, as described below.  In either
case, the editor (as described above) will always be invoked to give
an opportunity to modify the entries, and the changelog will be
accepted whether or not modifications are made.  An extra changelog
entry can be given on the command line in addition to the closes
entries.
.PP
At most one of \fB\-\-append\fR, \fB\-\-increment\fR and
\fB\-\-newversion\fR may be specified as listed below.  If no options
are specified, \fBdebcange\fR will look for an appropriate \fBdupload\fR(1)
or \fBdput\fR(1) log file in the parent directory to determine whether
this version of the package has been uploaded successfully.  It will
behave as if \fB\-\-increment\fR had been specified if a successful
upload has been logged and as if \fB\-\-append\fR had been specified
otherwise.  A warning will be issued if the log file is found but a
successful upload is not recorded.  This may be because the previous
upload was performed with a version of \fBdupload\fR prior to 2.1 or
because the upload failed.
.PP
If \fB\-\-increment\fR or \fB\-\-newversion\fR is used, the name and
email for the new version will be determined as follows.  If the
environment variable \fBDEBFULLNAME\fR is set, this will be used for
the maintainer full name.  If the environment variable \fBDEBEMAIL\fR
is set, this will be used for the email address.  If this variable has
the form "name <email>", then the maintainer name will also be taken
from here if \fBDEBFULLNAME\fR is not set.  If this variable is not
set, the same test is performed on the environment variable
\fBEMAIL\fR.  Next, if the full name has still not been determined,
then use \fBgetpwuid\fR(3) to determine the name from the password
file.  If this fails, use the previous changelog entry.  For the email
address, if it has not been set from \fBDEBEMAIL\fR or \fBEMAIL\fR,
then look in \fI/etc/mailname\fR, then attempt to build it from the
username and FQDN, otherwise use the email address in the previous
changelog entry.  In other words, it's a good idea to set
\fBDEBEMAIL\fR and \fBDEBFULLNAME\fR when using this script.
.PP
Support is included for changelogs that record changes by multiple
co-maintainers of a package. If an entry is appended to the current
version's entries, and the maintainer is different from the maintainer who
is listed as having done the previous entries, then lines will be added to
the changelog to tell which maintainers made which changes. Currently only
one of the several such styles of recording this information is supported,
in which the name of the maintainer who made a set of changes appears
on a line before the changes, inside square brackets.
.PP
If the directory name of the source tree has the form
\fIpackage\fR-\fIversion\fR, then \fBdebchange\fR will also attempt to
rename it if the (upstream) version number changes.  This can be
prevented by using the \fB\-\-preserve\fR command line or
configuration file option as described below.
.PP
If \fB\-\-force\-bad\-version\fR is used, debchange will not stop if
the new version is less than the current one.  This is especially
useful while doing backports. 
.SH "Directory name checking"
In common with several other scripts in the \fBdevscripts\fR package,
\fBdebchange\fR will climb the directory tree until it finds a
\fIdebian/changelog\fR file.  As a safeguard against stray files
causing potential problems, it will examine the name of the parent
directory once it finds the \fIdebian/changelog\fR file, and check
that the directory name corresponds to the package name.  Precisely
how it does this is controlled by two configuration file variables
DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL and DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_REGEX, and
their corresponding command-line options \fB\-\-check-dirname-level\fR
and \fB\-\-check-dirname-regex\fR.
.PP
DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL can take the following values:
.TP
.B 0
Never check the directory name.
.TP
.B 1
Only check the directory name if we have had to change directory in
our search for \fIdebian/changelog\fR.  This is the default behaviour.
.TP
.B 2
Always check the directory name.
.PP
The directory name is checked by testing whether the current directory
name (as determined by \fBpwd\fR(1)) matches the regex given by the
configuration file option DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_REGEX or by the
command line option \fB\-\-check-dirname-regex\fR \fIregex\fR.  Here
\fIregex\fR is a Perl regex (see \fBperlre\fR(3perl)), which will be
anchored at the beginning and the end.  If \fIregex\fR contains a '/',
then it must match the full directory path.  If not, then it must
match the full directory name.  If \fIregex\fR contains the string
\'PACKAGE', this will be replaced by the source package name, as
determined from the changelog.  The default value for the regex is:
\'PACKAGE(-.*)?', thus matching directory names such as PACKAGE and
PACKAGE-version.
.PP
The default changelog to be edited is \fIdebian/changelog\fR; however,
this can be changed using the \fB\-\-changelog\fR or \fB\-\-news\fR
options or the CHANGELOG environment variable, as described below.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-\-increment ", " \-i
Increment either the final component of the Debian release number or,
if this is a native Debian package, the version number.  This creates
a new section at the beginning of the changelog with appropriate
headers and footers.  Also, if this is a new version of a native
Debian package, the directory name is changed to reflect this.
.TP
.BR \-\-append ", " \-a
Add a new changelog entry at the end of the current version's entries.
.TP
\fB\-\-newversion \fIversion\fR, \fB\-v \fIversion\fR
This specifies the version number (including the Debian release part)
explicitly and behaves as the \fB\-\-increment\fR option in other
respects.  It will also change the directory name if the upstream
version number has changed.
.TP
.BR \-\-nmu ", " \-n
Increment the Debian release number for a non-maintainer upload by
either appending a ".1" to a non-NMU version number or by incrementing
an NMU version number.
.TP
.BR \-\-fromdirname ", " \-d
This will take the upstream version number from the directory name,
which should be of the form \fIpackage\fR-\fIversion\fR.  If the
upstream version number has increased from the most recent changelog
entry, then a new entry will be made with version number
\fIversion\fR-1 (or \fIversion\fR if the package is Debian native),
with the same epoch as the previous package version.  If the upstream
version number is the same, this option will behave in the same way as
\fB\-i\fR.
.TP
.BI \-\-closes nnnnn,[nnnnn,...]
Add changelog entries to close the specified bug numbers.  Also invoke
the editor after adding these entries.  Will generate warnings if the
BTS cannot be contacted (and \fB\-\-noquery\fR has not been
specified), or if there are problems with the bug report located.
.TP
.B \-\-[no]query
Should we attempt to query the BTS when generating closes entries?
.TP
.BR \-\-preserve ", " \-p
Preserve the source tree directory name if the upstream version number
(or the version number of a Debian native package) changes.  See also
the configuration variables section below.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-preserve
Do not preserve the source tree directory name (default).
.TP
\fB\-\-distribution \fIdist\fR, \fB\-D \fIdist\fR
Use the specified distribution in the new changelog entry, if any,
instead of using the previous changelog entry's distribution.
.TP
\fB\-\-urgency \fIurgency\fR, \fB\-u \fIurgency\fR
Use the specified urgency in the new changelog entry, if any,
instead of using the default "low".
.TP
\fB\-\-changelog \fIfile\fR, \fB\-c \fIfile\fR
This will edit the changelog \fIfile\fR instead of the standard
\fIdebian/changelog\fR.  This option overrides any CHANGELOG
environment variable setting.  Also, no directory traversing or
checking will be performed when this option is used.
.TP
\fB\-\-news\fR
This will edit \fIdebian/NEWS\fR instead of the regular
changelog.  Directory searching will be performed.  Cannot be used
together with \fB\-\-changelog\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-check-dirname-level\fR \fIN\fR
See the above section "Directory name checking" for an explanation of
this option.
.TP
\fB\-\-check-dirname-regex\fR \fIregex\fR
See the above section "Directory name checking" for an explanation of
this option.
.TP
\fB\-\-no-conf\fR, \fB\-\-noconf\fR
Do not read any configuration files.  This can only be used as the
first option given on the command-line.
.TP
.BR \-\-help ", " \-h
Display a help message and exit successfully.
.TP
.B \-\-version
Display version and copyright information and exit successfully.
.SH "CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
The two configuration files \fI/etc/devscripts.conf\fR and
\fI~/.devscripts\fR are sourced in that order to set configuration
variables.  Command line options can be used to override configuration
file settings.  Environment variable settings are ignored for this
purpose.  The currently recognised variables are:
.TP
.B DEBCHANGE_PRESERVE
If this is set to \fIyes\fR, then it is the same as the
\fB\-\-preserve\fR command line parameter being used.
.TP
.B DEBCHANGE_QUERY_BTS
If this is set to \fIno\fR, then it is the same as the
\fB\-\-noquery\fR command line parameter being used.
.TP
.BR DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL ", " DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_REGEX
See the above section "Directory name checking" for an explanation of
these variables.  Note that these are package-wide configuration
variables, and will therefore affect all \fBdevscripts\fR scripts
which check their value, as described in their respective manpages and
in \fBdevscripts.conf\fR(5).
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.BR DEBEMAIL ", " EMAIL ", " DEBFULLNAME
See the above description of the use of these environment variables.
.TP
.B CHANGELOG
This variable specifies the changelog to edit in place of
\fIdebian/changelog\fR.  No directory traversal or checking is
performed when this variable is set.  This variable is overridden by
the \fB\-\-changelog\fR command-line setting.
.TP
.BR VISUAL ", " EDITOR
These environment variables (in this order) determine the editor used
by \fBsensible-editor\fR.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR debclean (1),
.BR dupload (1),
.BR dput (1),
.BR debc (1)
and
.BR devscripts.conf (5).
