Usage: $PROGNAME <package> [<version-pattern>] [<architecture-pattern>]
  Downloads build logs of <package> from Debian auto-builders.
  If <version-pattern> or <architecture-pattern> are given, only build logs
  whose versions and architectures, respectively, matches the given patterns
  are downloaded.

  If <version-pattern> is "last" then only the logs for the most recent
  version of <package> found on buildd.debian.org will be downloaded.

  If <version-pattern> is "last-all" then the logs for the most recent
  version found on each build log index will be downloaded.
Options:
  -h, --help        Show this help message.
  -V, --version     Show version and copyright information.
Examples:
  # Download amd64 build log for hello version 2.2-1:
  $PROGNAME hello 2\.2-1 amd64

  # Download mips(el) build logs of all glibc versions:
  $PROGNAME glibc "" mips.*

  # Download all build logs of backported wesnoth versions:
