.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrc-alert\fR downloads the list of release-critical bugs from the
Debian BTS webpages, and then outputs a list of packages installed on
the system, or given on the command-line, which are in that list.
.P
If the directory \fI~/.devscripts_cache\fP exists or the
\fB\-\-cache\fP option is given, then the (sizable) downloaded list
will be cached, and will only be downloaded again on a second
invocation if it has changed.

are:

\fB\-\-includetags\fP.
.TP
.BR \-\-excludetagop
