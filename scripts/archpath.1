.TH ARCHPATH 1 "Debian Utilities" "DEBIAN" \" -*- nroff -*-
.SH NAME
archpath \- output arch (tla/Bazaar) archive names, with support for branches
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B archpath
.br
.B archpath
.I branch
.br
.B archpath
.IR branch \fB--\fI version
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B archpath
is intended to be run in an arch (tla or Bazaar) working copy.
.PP
In its simplest usage,
.B archpath
with no parameters outputs the package name
(archive/category--branch--version) associated with the working copy.
.PP
If a parameter is given, it may either be a branch--version, in which case
.B archpath
will output a corresponding package name in the current archive and
category, or a plain branch name (without \(oq--\(dq), in which case
.B archpath
will output a corresponding package name in the current archive and
category and with the same version as the current working copy.
.PP
This is useful for branching.
For example, if you're using Bazaar and you want to create a branch for a
new feature, you might use a command like this:
.PP
.RS
.nf
.ft CW
baz branch $(archpath) $(archpath new-feature)
.ft R
.fi
.RE
.PP
Or if you want to tag your current code onto a \(oqreleases\(cq branch as
version 1.0, you might use a command like this:
.PP
.RS
.nf
.ft CW
baz branch $(archpath) $(archpath releases--1.0)
.ft R
.fi
.RE
.PP
That's much easier than using \(oqbaz tree-version\(cq to look up the
package name and manually modifying the result.
