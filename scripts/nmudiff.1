.TH NMUDIFF 1 "Debian Utilities" "DEBIAN" \" -*- nroff -*-
.SH NAME
nmudiff \- email an NMU diff to the Debian BTS
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBnmudiff\fR [\fIoptions\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBnmudiff\fR should be run in the source tree of the package being
NMUed, after the NMU is built. It assumes that the source packages
(specifically, the .dsc and any corresponding tar and diff files) for
both the previous version of the package and the newly built NMU
version are in the parent directory. It then uses \fBdebdiff\fR to
generate a diff between the previous version and the current NMU, and
either runs mutt or an editor (using \fBsensible\-editor\fR) so that
the mail message (including the diff) can be examined and modified;
once you exit the editor the diff will be mailed to the Debian BTS.
.PP
The default behaviour is that if exactly one bug is closed by this NMU,
then that bug will be mailed, otherwise a new bug will be submitted.
This behaviour may be changed by command line options and
configuration file options.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-new
Instead of mailing the bug reports which are to be closed by this NMU,
a new bug report is submitted directly to the BTS.
.TP
.B \-\-old
Send the bug report to all of the bugs which are being closed by this
NMU, rather than opening a new bug report.  This option has no effect
if no bugs are being closed by this NMU.
.TP
\fB\-\-mutt\fR
Use \fBmutt\fR(1) for editing and sending the message to the BTS
(default behaviour).  This can be controlled using a configuration
file option (see below).
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-mutt\fR
Use \fBsensible\-editor\fR(1) to edit the message and then mail it
directly using \fI/usr/bin/sendmail\fR.  This can be controlled using
a configuration file option (see below).
.TP
\fB\-\-sendmail\fR \fISENDMAILCMD\fR
Specify the sendmail command.  The command will be split on white
space and will be interpreted by the shell.  Default is
\fI/usr/sbin/sendmail\fR.  The \fI\-t\fR option will be automatically
added if the command is \fI/usr/sbin/sendmail\fR or
\fI/usr/sbin/exim*\fR.  For other mailers, if they require a \fI\-t\fR
option, this must be included in the \fISENDMAILCMD\fR, for example:
\-\-sendmail="/usr/sbin/mymailer -t".  This can also be set using the
devscripts configuration files; see below.
.TP
\fB\-\-from\fR \fIEMAIL\fR
If using the sendmail (\fB\-\-no\-mutt) option, then the email to the
BTS will be sent using the name and address in the environment
variable DEBEMAIL.  If this is not set, then the variable EMAIL will
be used instead.  These can be overridden using the \fB\-\-from\fR
option.  The program will not work in this case if an email address
cannot be determined.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-conf\fR, \fB\-\-noconf\fR
Do not read any configuration files.  This can only be used as the
first option given on the command-line.
.TP
.B \-\-help
Display a help message and exit successfully.
.TP
.B \-\-version
Display version and copyright information and exit successfully.
.SH "CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
The two configuration files \fI/etc/devscripts.conf\fR and
\fI~/.devscripts\fR are sourced in that order to set configuration
variables.  Command line options can be used to override configuration
file settings.  Environment variable settings are ignored for this
purpose.  The currently recognised variables are:
.TP
.B NMUDIFF_MUTT
Can be "yes" (default) or "no", and specifies whether to use
\fBmutt\fR to compose and send the message or not, as described
above.
.TP
.B NMUDIFF_NEWREPORT
This option controls whether a new bug report is made, or whether the
diff is sent to the bugs closed by this NMU.  Can be "maybe"
(default), which sends to the existing bug reports if exactly one bug
is being closed; "yes", which always creates a new report, or "no",
which always sends to the reports of the bugs being closed (unless no
bugs are being closed, in which case a new report is always made).
.TP
.B BTS_SENDMAIL_COMMAND
If this is set, specifies a sendmail command to use instead of
/usr/sbin/sendmail.  Same as the --sendmail command line option.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR debdiff (1),
.BR sensible-editor (1)
and
.BR devscripts.conf (5).
