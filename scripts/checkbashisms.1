.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBcheckbashisms\fR \fIscript\fR ...

\fBcheckbashisms \-\-help|\-\-version\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcheckbashisms\fR, based on one of the checks from the \fBlintian\fR
system, performs basic checks on \fI/bin/sh\fR shell scripts for the
possible presence of bashisms.  It takes the names of the shell
scripts on the command line, and outputs warnings if possible bashisms
are detected.

Check for "echo -n" usage (non POSIX but required by Debian Policy 10.4.)
.TP
.BR \-\-force ", " \-f
Force each script to be checked, even if it would normally not be (for 
instance, it has a bash or non POSIX shell shebang or appears to be a 
shell wrapper).
.TP
.BR \-\-version ", " \-v
Show version and copyright information.
.SH "EXIT VALUES"
The exit value will be 0 if no possible bashisms or other problems
were detected.  Otherwise it will be the sum of the following error
values:
