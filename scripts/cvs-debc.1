.SH NAME
cvs-debc \- view contents of a cvs-buildpackage/cvs-debuild generated package
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBcvs-debc\fP [\fIoptions\fR] [\fIpackage\fR ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcvs-debc\fR is run from the CVS working directory after
\fBcvs-buildpackage\fR or \fBcvs-debuild\fR.  It uses the
\fBcvs-buildpackage\fR system to locate the \fI.changes\fR file
generated in that run.  It then displays information about the .deb
files which were generated in that run, by running \fBdpkg-deb \-I\fR
and \fBdpkg-deb \-c\fR on every \fI.deb\fR archive listed in
the \fI.changes\fR file, assuming that all of the \fI.deb\fR archives
live in the same directory as the \fI.changes\fR file.  It is
useful for ensuring that the expected files have ended up in the
Debian package.
.PP
If a list of packages is given on the command line, then only those
debs with names in this list of packages will be processed.
.PP
Note that unlike \fBcvs-buildpackage\fR, the only way to specify the
source package name is with the \fB\-P\fR option; you cannot simply
have it as the last command-line parameter.
.SH OPTIONS
