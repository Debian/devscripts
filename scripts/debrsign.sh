# This program is used to REMOTELY sign a .dsc and .changes file
# pair in the form needed for a legal Debian upload.  It is based on
# dpkg-buildpackage and debsign (which is also part of the devscripts
# package).
#
# In order for this program to work, debsign must be installed
# on the REMOTE machine which will be used to sign your package.
# You should run this program from within the package directory on
# the build machine.
