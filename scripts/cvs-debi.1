.SH NAME
cvs-debi \- install cvs-buildpackage/cvs-debuild generated package
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBcvs-debi\fP [\fIoptions\fR] [\fIpackage\fR ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcvs-debi\fR is run from the CVS working directory after
\fBcvs-buildpackage\fR or \fBcvs-debuild\fR.  It uses the
\fBcvs-buildpackage\fR system to locate the \fI.changes\fR file
generated in that run.  It then runs \fBdebpkg \-i\fR on
every \fI.deb\fR archive listed in the \fI.changes\fR file to install
them, assuming that all of the \fI.deb\fR archives live in the same
directory as the \fI.changes\fR file.  Note that you probably don't
want to run this program on a \fI.changes\fR file relating to a
different architecture after cross-compiling the package!
.PP
If a list of packages is given on the command line, then only those
debs with names in this list of packages will be installed.
.PP
Note that unlike \fBcvs-buildpackage\fR, the only way to specify the
source package name is with the \fB\-P\fR option; you cannot simply
have it as the last command-line parameter.
.PP
Since installing a package requires root privileges, \fBdebi\fR calls
\fBdebpkg\fR rather than \fBdpkg\fR directly.  Thus \fBdebi\fR will
only be useful if it is either being run as root or \fBdebpkg\fR can
be run as root.  See \fBdebpkg\fR(1) for more details.
.SH OPTIONS
All current \fBcvs-buildpackage\fR options are silently accepted;
however, only the ones listed below have any effect.  For more details
on all of them, see the \fBcvs-buildpackage\fR(1) manpage.

\fB\-a\fIdebian-architecture\fR, \fB\-t\fIGNU-system-type\fR
See \fBdpkg-architecture\fR(1) for a description of these options.
They affect the search for the \fI.changes\fR file.  They are provided
to mimic the behaviour of \fBdpkg-buildpackage\fR when determining the
name of the \fI.changes\fR file.
.TP
.BR \-M\fImodule
The name of the CVS module.
.TP
.BR \-P\fIpackage
The name of the package.
.TP
.B \-V\fIversion

The CVS tag to use for exporting sources.
.TP
.B \-R\fIroot\ directory

.TP
.B \-W\fIwork directory
The full path name for the cvs-buildpackage working directory.
.TP
.B \-x\fIprefix
This option provides the CVS default module prefix.
.TP
