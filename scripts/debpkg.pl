# All this program does is to check that it is either running as root
# or setuid root, and then exec dpkg with the command line options.

# As this may be running setuid, we make sure to clean out the
# environment before we go further.  Also wise for building the
# packages, anyway.  We don't put /usr/local/bin in the PATH as Debian
# programs will presumably be built without the use of any locally
# installed programs.  This could be changed, but in which case,
# you probably want to add /usr/local/bin at the END so that you don't
# get any unexpected behaviour.
