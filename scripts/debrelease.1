.SH NAME
debrelease \- a wrapper around dupload or dput
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdebrelease\fR [\fIdebrelease options\fR] [\fIdupload/dput options\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdebrelease\fR is a simple wrapper around \fBdupload\fR or
\fBdput\fR.  It is called from within the source code tree of a
package, and figures out the current version of a package.  It then
looks for the corresponding \fI.changes\fR file (which lists the files
needed to upload in order to release the package) in the parent
directory of the source code tree and calls \fBdupload\fR or
\fBdput\fR with the \fI.changes\fR file as parameter in order to
perform the actual uploading.
.PP
Options may be given to \fBdebrelease\fR; except for the ones listed
below, they are passed on unchanged to \fBdupload\fR or \fBdput\fR.
The \fBdevscripts\fR configuration files are also read by
\fBdebrelease\fR as described below.
.SH "Directory name checking"
In common with several other scripts in the \fBdevscripts\fR package,
\fBdebrelease\fR will climb the directory tree until it finds a
\fIdebian/changelog\fR file.  As a safeguard against stray files
causing potential problems, it will examine the name of the parent
directory once it finds the \fIdebian/changelog\fR file, and check
that the directory name corresponds to the package name.  Precisely
how it does this is controlled by two configuration file variables
\fBDEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL\fR and \fBDEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_REGEX\fR, and
their corresponding command-line options \fB\-\-check-dirname-level\fR
and \fB\-\-check-dirname-regex\fR.
.PP
\fBDEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL\fR can take the following values:
.TP
.B 0
Never check the directory name.
.TP
.B 1
Only check the directory name if we have had to change directory in
our search for \fIdebian/changelog\fR.  This is the default behaviour.
.TP
.B 2
Always check the directory name.
.PP
The directory name is checked by testing whether the current directory
name (as determined by \fBpwd\fR(1)) matches the regex given by the
configuration file option \fBDEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_REGEX\fR or by the
command line option \fB\-\-check-dirname-regex\fR \fIregex\fR.  Here
\fIregex\fR is a Perl regex (see \fBperlre\fR(3perl)), which will be
anchored at the beginning and the end.  If \fIregex\fR contains a '/',
then it must match the full directory path.  If not, then it must
match the full directory name.  If \fIregex\fR contains the string
\'PACKAGE', this will be replaced by the source package name, as
determined from the changelog.  The default value for the regex is:
\'PACKAGE(-.+)?', thus matching directory names such as PACKAGE and
PACKAGE-version.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-dupload\fR, \fB\-\-dput\fR
This specifies which uploader program to use; the default is
\fBdupload\fR.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR
If this option is used, or the default \fI.changes\fR file is
not found but a source-only \fI.changes\fR file is present, then this
source-only \fI.changes\fR file will be uploaded instead of an
arch-specific one.
.TP
\fB\-a\fIdebian-architecture\fR, \fB\-t\fIGNU-system-type\fR
See \fBdpkg-architecture\fR(1) for a description of these options.
They affect the search for the \fI.changes\fR file.  They are provided
to mimic the behaviour of \fBdpkg-buildpackage\fR when determining the
name of the \fI.changes\fR file.  If a plain \fB\-t\fR is given, it is
taken to be the \fBdupload\fR host-specifying option, and therefore
signifies the end of the \fBdebrelease\fR-specific options.
.TP
\fB\-\-multi\fR
Multiarch changes mode: This signifies that \fBdebrelease\fR should
use the most recent file with the name pattern
\fIpackage_version_*+*.changes\fR as the changes file, allowing for the
changes files produced by \fBdpkg-cross\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-debs\-dir\fR \fIdirectory\fR
Look for the \fI.changes\fR and \fI.deb\fR files in \fIdirectory\fR
instead of the parent of the source directory.  This should
either be an absolute path or relative to the top of the source
directory.
.TP
\fB\-\-check-dirname-level\fR \fIN\fR
See the above section \fBDirectory name checking\fR for an explanation of
this option.
.TP
\fB\-\-check-dirname-regex\fR \fIregex\fR
See the above section \fBDirectory name checking\fR for an explanation of
this option.
.TP
\fB\-\-no-conf\fR, \fB\-\-noconf\fR
Do not read any configuration files.  This can only be used as the
first option given on the command-line.
.TP
.BR \-\-help ", " \-h
Display a help message and exit successfully.
.TP
.B \-\-version
Display version and copyright information and exit successfully.
.SH "CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
The two configuration files \fI/etc/devscripts.conf\fR and
\fI~/.devscripts\fR are sourced in that order to set configuration
variables.  Command line options can be used to override configuration
file settings.  Environment variable settings are ignored for this
purpose.  The currently recognised variables are:
.TP
.B DEBRELEASE_UPLOADER
The currently recognised values are \fIdupload\fR and \fIdput\fR, and
it specifies which uploader program should be used.  It corresponds to
the \fB\-\-dupload\fR and \fB\-\-dput\fR command line options.
.TP
.B DEBRELEASE_DEBS_DIR
This specifies the directory in which to look for the \fI.changes\fR
and \fI.deb\fR files, and is either an absolute path or relative to
the top of the source tree.  This corresponds to the
\fB\-\-debs\-dir\fR command line option.  This directive could be
used, for example, if you always use \fBpbuilder\fR or
\fBsvn-buildpackage\fR to build your packages.  Note that it also
affects \fBdebc\fR(1) and \fBdebi\fR(1).
.TP
.BR DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL ", " DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_REGEX
See the above section \fBDirectory name checking\fR for an explanation of
these variables.  Note that these are package-wide configuration
variables, and will therefore affect all \fBdevscripts\fR scripts
which check their value, as described in their respective manpages and
in \fBdevscripts.conf\fR(5).
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR dupload (1),
.BR dput (1)
and
.BR devscripts.conf (5).
