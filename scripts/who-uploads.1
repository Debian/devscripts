.TH WHO-UPLOADS 1 "Debian Utilities" "DEBIAN" \" -*- nroff -*-
.SH NAME
who-uploads \- identify the uploaders of Debian source packages
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBwho\-uploads\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fIsource_package\fR ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBwho\-uploads\fR uses the Package Tracking System (PTS) to identify
the uploaders of the three most recent versions of the given source
packages.  Note that the uploaders are identified using their
\fBgpg\fR(1) keys; installing a recent version of the
\fIdebian-keyring\fR package should provide most of the required keys.
.PP
Note that because the PTS uses source packages, you must give the
source package names, not the binary package names.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-max\-uploads=\fIN\fR
Specify the maximum number of uploads to display for each package; the
default is 3.  Note that you may not see this many uploads if there
are not this many recorded in the PTS.
.TP
\fB\-\-keyring \fIkeyring\fR
Add \fIkeyring\fR to the list of keyrings to be searched for the
uploader's GPG key.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-default\-keyrings\fR
By default, \fBwho\-uploads\fR uses the two Debian keyrings
\fI/usr/share/keyrings/debian-keyring.gpg\fR and
\fI/usr/share/keyrings/debian-maintainers.gpg\fR (although this
default can be changed in the configuration file, see below).
Specifying this option means that the default keyrings will not be
examined.  The \fB\-\-keyring\fR option overrides this one.
.TP
\fB\-\-date\fR
Show the date of the upload alongside the uploader's details
.TP
.BR \-\-nodate ", " \-\-no\-date
Do not show the date of the upload alongside the uploader's details.
This is the default behaviour.
.TP
\fB\-\-no-conf\fR, \fB\-\-noconf\fR
Do not read any configuration files.  This can only be used as the
first option given on the command-line.
.TP
.BR \-\-help ", " \-h
Display a help message and exit successfully.
.TP
.B \-\-version
Display version and copyright information and exit successfully.
.SH "CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
The two configuration files \fI/etc/devscripts.conf\fR and
\fI~/.devscripts\fR are sourced in that order to set configuration
variables.  Command line options can be used to override configuration
file settings.  Environment variable settings are ignored for this
purpose.  The currently recognised variables are:
.TP
.B WHOUPLOADS_DATE
Show the date of the upload alongside the uploader's details.  By
default, this is "no".
.TP
.B WHOUPLOADS_MAXUPLOADS
The maximum number of uploads to display for each package.  By
default, this is 3.
.TP
.B WHOUPLOADS_KEYRINGS
This is a colon-separated list of the default keyrings to be used.  By
default, it is the two Debian keyrings
\fI/usr/share/keyrings/debian-keyring.gpg\fR
and
\fI/usr/share/keyrings/debian-maintainers.gpg\fR.
