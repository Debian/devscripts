=head1 NAME

namecheck - Check project names are not already taken.

=head1 ABOUT

This is a simple tool to automate the testing of project names at the most
common Open Source / Free Software hosting environments.

Each new project requires a name, and those names are ideally unique.  To come
up with names is hard, and testing to ensure they're not already in use is
time-consuming - unless you have a tool such as this one.

=head1 CUSTOMIZATION

The script, as-is, contains a list of sites, and patterns, to test against.

If those patterns aren't sufficient then you may create your own additions and
add them to the script.  If you wish to have your own version of the patterns
you may save them into the file ~/.namecheckrc
