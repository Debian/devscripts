.TH DD\-LIST 1 2011-10-27 "Debian"
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH NAME
dd\-list \- nicely list .deb packages and their maintainers
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR dd\-list " [" \-hiusV "] [" \-\-help "] [" \-\-stdin "]"
.BR "" "[" "\-\-sources \fISources_file" "]
.BR "" "[" \-\-dctrl "] [" \-\-version "] [" \-\-uploaders "] [" \fIpackage " ...]"
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dd\-list
produces nicely formatted lists of Debian (.deb) packages and their
maintainers.
.PP
Input is a list of source or binary package names on the command line
(or the standard input if
.B \-\-stdin
is given).
Output is a list of the following format, where package names are source
packages by default:
.PP
.nf
.RS
J. Random Developer <jrandom@debian.org>
.RS
j-random-package
j-random-other
.RE
.PP
Diana Hacker <diana@example.org>
.RS
fun-package
more-fun-package
.RE
.RE
.fi
.PP
This is useful when you want, for example, to produce a list of packages
that need to attention from their maintainers, e.g., to be rebuilt when
a library version transition happens.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Print brief help message.
.TP
.BR \-i ", " \-\-stdin
Read package names from the standard input, instead of taking them
from the command line. Package names are whitespace delimited.
.TP
.BR \-d ", " \-\-dctrl
Read package list from standard input in the format of a Debian
package control file. This includes the status file, or output of
apt-cache. This is the fastest way to use dd-list, as it uses the
maintainer information from the input instead of looking up the maintainer
of each listed package.
.IP
If no \fISource:\fP line is given, the \fIPackage:\fP name is used for
output, which might be a binary package name.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-sources\fR \fISources_file\fR
Read package information from the specified \fISources_file\fRs.  This can be
given multiple times.
.IP
If no \fISources_file\fRs are specified, any files matching
\fI/var/lib/apt/lists/*_source_Sources\fR will be used.
.TP
.BR \-u ", " \-\-uploaders
Also list developers who are named as uploaders of packages, not only
the maintainers; this is the default behaviour, use \-\-nouploaders to
prevent it. Uploaders are indicated with "(U)" appended to the package name.
.TP
.BR \-nou ", " \-\-nouploaders
Only list package Maintainers, do not list Uploaders.
.TP
.BR \-b ", " \-\-print\-binary
Use binary package names in the output instead of source package names
(has no effect with \fB--dctrl\fP if the \fIPackage:\fP line contains
source package names).
.TP
.BR \-V ", " \-\-version
Print the version.
