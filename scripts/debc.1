.SH NAME
debc \- view contents of a generated Debian package
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdebc\fP [\fIoptions\fR] [\fIchanges file\fR] [\fIpackage\fR ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdebc\fR figures out the current version of a package and displays
information about the .deb and .udeb files which have been generated
in the current build process.  If a \fI.changes\fR file is specified
on the command line, the filename must end with \fI.changes\fR, as
this is how the program distinguishes it from package names.  If not,
then \fBdebc\fR has to be called from within the source code directory
tree.  In this case, it will look for the \fI.changes\fR file
corresponding to the current package version (by determining the name
and version number from the changelog, and the architecture in the
same way as \fBdpkg-buildpackage\fR(1) does).  It then runs
\fBdpkg-deb \-I\fR and \fBdpkg-deb \-c\fR on every \fI.deb\fR and
\fI.udeb\fR archive listed in the \fI.changes\fR file to display
information about the contents of the \fI.deb\fR / \fI.udeb\fR files.
It precedes every \fI.deb\fR or \fI.udeb\fR file with the name of the
file.  It assumes that all of the \fI.deb\fR / \fI.udeb\fR archives
live  in the same directory as the \fI.changes\fR file.  It is
useful for ensuring that the expected files have ended up in the
Debian package.
.PP
If a list of packages is given on the command line, then only those
debs or udebs with names in this list of packages will be processed.
.SH "Directory name checking"
In common with several other scripts in the \fBdevscripts\fR package,
\fBdebc\fR will climb the directory tree until it finds a
\fIdebian/changelog\fR file.  As a safeguard against stray files
causing potential problems, it will examine the name of the parent
directory once it finds the \fIdebian/changelog\fR file, and check
that the directory name corresponds to the package name.  Precisely
how it does this is controlled by two configuration file variables
\fBDEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL\fR and \fBDEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_REGEX\fR, and
their corresponding command-line options \fB\-\-check-dirname-level\fR
and \fB\-\-check-dirname-regex\fR.
.PP
\fBDEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL\fR can take the following values:
.TP
.B 0
Never check the directory name.
.TP
.B 1
Only check the directory name if we have had to change directory in
our search for \fIdebian/changelog\fR.  This is the default behaviour.
.TP
.B 2
Always check the directory name.
.PP
The directory name is checked by testing whether the current directory
name (as determined by \fBpwd\fR(1)) matches the regex given by the
configuration file option \fBDEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_REGEX\fR or by the
command line option \fB\-\-check-dirname-regex\fR \fIregex\fR.  Here
\fIregex\fR is a Perl regex (see \fBperlre\fR(3perl)), which will be
anchored at the beginning and the end.  If \fIregex\fR contains a '/',
then it must match the full directory path.  If not, then it must
match the full directory name.  If \fIregex\fR contains the string
\'PACKAGE', this will be replaced by the source package name, as
determined from the changelog.  The default value for the regex is:
\'PACKAGE(-.+)?', thus matching directory names such as PACKAGE and
PACKAGE-version.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-a\fIdebian-architecture\fR, \fB\-t\fIGNU-system-type\fR
See \fBdpkg-architecture\fR(1) for a description of these options.
They affect the search for the \fI.changes\fR file.  They are provided
to mimic the behaviour of \fBdpkg-buildpackage\fR when determining the
name of the \fI.changes\fR file.
.TP
\fB\-\-debs\-dir\fR \fIdirectory\fR
Look for the \fI.changes\fR, \fI.deb\fR and \fI.udeb\fR files in
\fIdirectory\fR instead of the parent of the source directory.
This should either be an absolute path or relative to the top of the
source directory.
.TP
\fB\-\-check-dirname-level\fR \fIN\fR
See the above section \fBDirectory name checking\fR for an explanation of
this option.
.TP
\fB\-\-check-dirname-regex\fR \fIregex\fR
See the above section \fBDirectory name checking\fR for an explanation of
this option.
.TP
\fB\-\-no-conf\fR, \fB\-\-noconf\fR
Do not read any configuration files.  This can only be used as the
first option given on the command-line.
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Show help message and version information respectively.
.SH "CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
The two configuration files \fI/etc/devscripts.conf\fR and
\fI~/.devscripts\fR are sourced in that order to set configuration
variables.  Command line options can be used to override configuration
file settings.  Environment variable settings are ignored for this
purpose.  The currently recognised variables are:
.TP
.B DEBRELEASE_DEBS_DIR
This specifies the directory in which to look for the \fI.changes\fR,
\fI.deb\fR and \fI.udeb\fR files, and is either an absolute path or
relative to the top of the source tree.  This corresponds to the
\fB\-\-debs\-dir\fR command line option.  This directive could be
used, for example, if you always use \fBpbuilder\fR or
\fBsvn-buildpackage\fR to build your packages.  Note that it also
affects \fBdebrelease\fR(1) in the same way, hence the strange name of
the option.
.TP
.BR DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL ", " DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_REGEX
See the above section \fBDirectory name checking\fR for an explanation of
these variables.  Note that these are package-wide configuration
variables, and will therefore affect all \fBdevscripts\fR scripts
which check their value, as described in their respective manpages and
in \fBdevscripts.conf\fR(5).
.SH "SEE ALSO"
