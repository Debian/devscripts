# this script is part of debbisect and usually called by debbisect itself
#
# it accepts six or eight arguments:
#    1. dependencies
#    2. script name or shell snippet
#    3. mirror URL
#    4. architecture
#    5. suite
#    6. components
#    7. (optional) second mirror URL
#    8. (optional) package to upgrade
#
# It will create an ephemeral chroot using mmdebstrap using (3.) as mirror,
# (4.) as architecture, (5.) as suite and (6.) as components, install the
# dependencies given in (1.) and execute the script given in (2.).
# Its output is the exit code of the script as well as a file ./pkglist
# containing the output of "dpkg-query -W" inside the chroot.
#
# If not only six but eight arguments are given, then the second mirror URL
# (7.) will be added to the apt sources and the single package (8.) will be
# upgraded to its version from (7.).
