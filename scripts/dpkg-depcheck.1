.TH DPKG-DEPCHECK "1" "March 2002" "dpkg-depcheck" DEBIAN
.SH NAME
dpkg-depcheck \- determine packages used to execute a command
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdpkg-depcheck\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fIcommand\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program runs the specified command under \fBstrace\fR and then
determines and outputs the packages used in the process.  The list can
be trimmed in various ways as described in the options below.  A good
example of this program would be the command \fBdpkg-depcheck \-b
debian/rules build\fR, which would give a good first approximation to
the Build-Depends line needed by a Debian package.  Note, however,
that this does \fInot\fR give any direct information on versions
required or architecture-specific packages.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-a ", " \-\-all
Report all packages used to run \fIcommand\fR.  This is the default
behaviour.  If used in conjunction with \fB\-b\fR, \fB\-d\fR or
\fB\-m\fR, gives additional information on those packages skipped by
these options.
.TP
.BR \-b ", " \-\-build-depends
Do not report any build-essential or essential packages used, or any
of their (direct or indirect) dependencies.
.TP
.BR \-d ", " \-\-ignore-dev-deps
Do not show packages used which are direct dependencies of \fI\-dev\fR
packages used.  This implies \fB\-b\fR.
.TP
.BR \-m ", " \-\-min-deps
Output a minimal set of packages needed, taking into account direct
dependencies.  Using \fB\-m\fR implies \fB\-d\fR and also \fB\-b\fR.
.TP
.BR \-C ", " \-\-C-locale
Run \fIcommand\fR with the C locale.
.TP
.BR \-\-no-C-locale
Don't change locale when running \fIcommand\fR.
.TP
.BR \-l ", " \-\-list-files
Also report the list of files used in each package.
.TP
.BR \-\-no-list-files
Do not report the files used in each package.  Cancels a \fB\-l\fR
option.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output=\fIFILE\fR
Output the package diagnostics to \fIFILE\fR instead of stdout.
.TP
\fB\-O\fR, \fB\-\-strace-output=\fIFILE\fR
Write the \fBstrace\fR output to \fIFILE\fR when tracing \fIcommand\fR
instead of using a temporary file.
.TP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-strace-input=\fIFILE\fR
Get \fBstrace\fR output from \fIFILE\fR instead of tracing
\fIcommand\fR; \fBstrace\fR must have be run with the \fB\-f \-q\fR
options for this to work.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-features=\fILIST\fR
Enable or disabled features given in the comma-separated \fILIST\fR as
follows.  A feature is enabled with \fI+feature\fR or just
\fIfeature\fR and disabled with \fI\-feature\fR.  The currently
recognised features are:
.PD 0
.RS
.TP
.B warn\-local
Warn if files in \fI/usr/local\fR or \fI/var/local\fR are used.
Enabled by default.
.TP
.B discard-check-version
Discards \fIexecve\fR when only a \fI\-\-version\fR argument is given
to the program; this works around some configure scripts that check
for binaries they don't actually use.  Enabled by default.
.TP
.B trace-local
Also try to identify files which are accessed in \fI/usr/local\fR and
\fI/var/local\fR.  Not usually very useful, as Debian does not place
files in these directories.  Disabled by default.
.TP
.B catch-alternatives
Warn about access to files controlled by the Debian \fIalternatives\fR
mechanism.  Enabled by default.
.TP
.B discard-sgml-catalogs
Discards access to SGML catalogs; some SGML tools read all the registered
catalogs at startup.  Files matching the regexp /usr/share/sgml/.*\\.cat are
recognised  as catalogs.  Enabled by default.
.PD
.RE
.TP
\fB\-\-no-conf\fR, \fB\-\-noconf\fR
Do not read any configuration files.  This can only be used as the
first option given on the command-line.
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Display usage information and exit.
.TP
.BR \-v ", " \-\-version
Display version and copyright information and exit.
.SH "CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
The two configuration files \fI/etc/devscripts.conf\fR and
\fI~/.devscripts\fR are sourced in that order to set configuration
variables.  Command line options can be used to override configuration
file settings.  Environment variable settings are ignored for this
purpose.  The currently recognised variable is:
.TP
.B DPKG_DEPCHECK_OPTIONS
These are options which are parsed before the command-line options.
For example,
.IP
DPKG_DEPCHECK_OPTIONS="\-b \-f-catch-alternatives"
.IP
which passes these options to \fBdpkg-depcheck\fR before any
command-line options are processed.  You are advised not to try tricky
quoting, because of the vagaries of shell quoting!
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR dpkg (1),
.BR strace (1),
.BR update-alternatives (8)
and
.BR devscripts.conf (5).
