.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgetbuildlog\fR downloads build logs of \fIpackage\fR from Debian
auto\-builders. It downloads build logs of all versions and for all

not specified or empty, otherwise only build logs whose versions match
\fIversion-pattern\fR and build logs whose architectures match
\fIarchitecture-pattern\fR will be downloaded. The version and architecture
patterns are interpreted as extended regular expressions as described in
\fBgrep\fR(1).

recent version of \fIpackage\fR found on buildd.debian.org will be
