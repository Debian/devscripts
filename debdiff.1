.SH NAME
debdiff \- compare file lists in two Debian packages
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdebdiff\fR [\fIoptions\fR] ... \fIdeb1 deb2\fR
.br
\fBdebdiff\fR [\fIoptions\fR] ... \fIchanges1 changes2\fR
.br
\fBdebdiff\fR [\fIoptions\fR] ... \fB\-\-from \fIdeb1a deb1b ...
\fB\-\-to \fIdeb2a deb2b ...\fR
.br
\fBdebdiff\fR [\fIoptions\fR] ... \fIdsc1 dsc2\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdebdiff\fR takes the names of two Debian package files
(\fI.deb\fRs) on the command line and compares their contents
(considering only the files in the main package, not the maintenance
scripts).  It shows which files have been introduced and which removed
between the two package files, and is therefore useful for spotting
files which may have been inadvertently lost between revisions of the
package.  It also compares the control files of the two packages using
the \fBwdiff\fR program.
.PP
\fBdebdiff\fR can also handle changes between groups of \fI.deb\fR
files in two ways.  The first is to specify two \fI.changes\fR files.
In this case, the \fI.deb\fR files listed in the \fI.changes\fR file
will be compared, by taking the contents of all of the
listed \fI.deb\fR files together.  (The \fI.deb\fR files listed are
assumed to be in the same directory as the \fI.changes\fR file.)  The
second way is to list the \fI.deb\fR files of interest specifically
using the \fB\-\-from\fR ... \fB\-\-to\fR syntax.  These both help if
a package is broken up into smaller packages and one wishes to ensure
that nothing is lost in the interim.  The control files are compared
in both of these cases only when there is only one \fI.deb\fR involved
on each side of the comparison.
.PP
\fBdebdiff\fR examines the \fBdevscripts\fR configuration files as
described below.  Command line options override the configuration file
settings, though.
.PP
If \fBdebdiff\fR is passed two source packages (\fI.dsc\fR files) it
will compare the contents of the source packages.  If the source
packages differ only in Debian revision number (that is,
the \fI.orig.tar.gz\fR files are the same in the two \fI.dsc\fR
files), then \fBinterdiff\fR(1) will be used to compare the two patch
files if this program is available on the system, otherwise a
\fBdiff\fR will be performed between the two source trees.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-\-dirs ", " \-d
The default mode of operation is to ignore directory names which
appear in the filelist, but they, too, will be considered if this
option is given.
.TP
.B \-\-nodirs
Ignore directory names which appear in the filelist.  This is the
default and it can be used to override a configuration file setting.
.TP
.BI \-\-move " FROM TO" "\fR,\fP \-m" " FROM TO"
It sometimes occurs that various files or directories are moved around
between revisions.  This can be handled using this option.  There are
two arguments, the first giving the location of the directory or file
in the first package, and the second in the second.  Any files in the
first listing whose names begin with the first argument are treated as
having that substituted for the second argument when the file lists
are compared.  Any number of \fB\-\-move\fR arguments may be given;
they are processed in the order in which they appear.
.TP
.BI \-\-move\-regex " FROM TO"
This is the same as \fB\-\-move\fR, except that \fIFROM\fR is treated
as a regular expression and the \fBperl\fR substitution command
\fIs/^FROM/TO/\fR is applied to the files.  In particular, TO can make
use of backreferences such as $1.
.TP
.B \-\-nocontrol
If \fBdebdiff\fR is called with two \fI.deb\fR files specified by
name, then it will compare the respective control files using
\fBwdiff\fR(1).  This option suppresses this part of the processing.
.TP
.B \-\-control
Compare the respective control files; this is the default, and it can
be used to override a configuration file setting.
.TP
.BR \-\-wp ", " \-\-wl ", " \-\-wt
Pass a \fB\-p\fR, \fB\-l\fR or \fB\-t\fR option to \fBwdiff\fR
respectively.  (This yields the whole \fBwdiff\fR output rather than
just the lines with any changes.)
.TP
.B \-\-show-moved
If multiple \fI.deb\fR files are specified on the command line, either
using \fI.changes\fR files or the \fB\-\-from\fR/\fB\-\-to\fR syntax,
then this option will also show which files (if any) have moved
between packages.  (The package names are simply determined from the
names of the \fI.deb\fR files.)
.TP
.B \-\-noshow-moved
The default behaviour; can be used to override a configuration file
setting.
.TP
.BI \-\-renamed " FROM TO"
If \fB\-\-show-moved\fR is being used and a package has been renamed
in the process, this command instructs \fBdebdiff\fR to treat the
package in the first list called \fIFROM\fR as if it were called
\fITO\fR.  Multiple uses of this option are permitted.
.TP
\fB\-\-no-conf\fR, \fB\-\-noconf\fR
Do not read any configuration files.  This can only be used as the
first option given on the command-line.
.TP
.BR \-\-help ", " \-h
Show a summary of options.
.TP
.BR \-\-version ", " \-v
Show version and copyright information.
.SH "CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
The two configuration files \fI/etc/devscripts.conf\fR and
\fI~/.devscripts\fR are sourced by a shell in that order to set
configuration variables.  Command line options can be used to override
configuration file settings.  Environment variable settings are
ignored for this purpose.  The currently recognised variables are:
.TP
.B DEBDIFF_DIRS
If this is set to \fIyes\fR, then it is the same as the
\fB\-\-dirs\fR command line parameter being used.
.TP
.B DEBDIFF_CONTROL
If this is set to \fIno\fR, then it is the same as the
\fB\-\-nocontrol\fR command line parameter being used.  The default is
\fIyes\fR.
.TP
.B DEBDIFF_SHOW_MOVED
If this is set to \fIyes\fR, then it is the same as the
\fB\-\-show\-moved\fR command line parameter being used.
.TP
.B DEBDIFF_WDIFF_OPT
This option will be passed to \fBwdiff\fR; it should be one of
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-l\fR or \fB\-t\fR.
.SH "EXIT VALUES"
Normally the exit value will be 0.  If there is some fatal error, the
exit code will be non-zero.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR dpkg-deb (1),
.BR wdiff (1),
.BR interdiff (1)
and
.BR devscripts.conf (5).
