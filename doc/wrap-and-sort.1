.TH WRAP\-AND\-SORT 1 "Debian Utilities" "DEBIAN"
.SH NAME
wrap-and-sort \- wrap long lines and sort items in Debian packaging files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wrap-and-sort

default the lists will only split into multiple lines if the entries are longer
than 80 characters. \fBwrap\-and\-sort\fP sorts the package lists in Debian
control files and all \fI.install\fR files. Beside that \fBwrap\-and\-sort\fP removes
trailing spaces in these files.
.PP
This script should be run in the root of a Debian package tree. It searches for
\fIcontrol\fR, \fIcontrol.in\fR, \fIcopyright\fR, \fIcopyright.in\fR, \fIinstall\fR, and \fI*.install\fR in the
\fIdebian\fR directory.
