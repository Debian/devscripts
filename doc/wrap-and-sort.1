.TH WRAP\-AND\-SORT 1 "Debian Utilities" "DEBIAN"
.SH NAME
wrap-and-sort \- wrap long lines and sort items in Debian packaging files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wrap-and-sort
[\fIoptions\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBwrap\-and\-sort\fP wraps the package lists in Debian control files. By
default the lists will only split into multiple lines if the entries are longer
than the maximum line length limit of 79 characters. \fBwrap\-and\-sort\fP sorts
the package lists in Debian control files and all \fI.dirs\fR, \fI.docs\fR,
\fI.examples\fR, \fI.info\fR, \fI.install\fR, \fI.links\fR, \fI.maintscript\fR,
and \fI.manpages\fR files. Beside that \fBwrap\-and\-sort\fP removes trailing
spaces in these files.
.PP
This script should be run in the root of a Debian package tree. It searches for
\fIcontrol\fR, \fIcontrol*.in\fR, \fIcopyright\fR, \fIcopyright.in\fR,
\fIinstall\fR, and \fI*.install\fR in the \fIdebian\fR directory.

Show this help message and exit.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-wrap\-always\fR

even if they do not exceed the line length limit and could fit in one line.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-short\-indent\fR
Only indent wrapped lines by one space (default is in\-line with the

Sort binary package paragraphs by name.

\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-no\-cleanup\fR
Do not remove trailing whitespaces.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-trailing-comma\fR
Add a trailing comma at the end of the sorted fields. This minimizes
