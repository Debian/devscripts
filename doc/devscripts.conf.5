.TH DEVSCRIPTS.CONF 5 "Debian Utilities" "DEBIAN" \" -*- nroff -*-
.SH NAME
devscripts.conf \- configuration file for the devscripts package
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBdevscripts\fR package provides a collection of scripts which
may be of use to Debian developers and others wishing to build Debian
packages.  Many of these have options which can be configured on a
system-wide and per-user basis.
.PP
Every script in the \fBdevscripts\fR package which makes use of values
from these configuration files describes the specific settings
recognised in its own manpage.  (For a list of the scripts, either see
\fI/usr/share/doc/devscripts/README.gz\fR or look at the output of
\fIdpkg \-L devscripts | grep /usr/bin\fR.)
.PP
The two configuration files are \fI/etc/devscripts.conf\fR for
system-wide defaults and \fI~/.devscripts\fR for per-user settings.
They are written with \fBbash\fR(1) syntax, but should only have
comments and simple variable assignments in them; they are both
sourced (if present) by many of the \fBdevscripts\fR scripts.
Variables corresponding to simple switches should have one of the
values \fIyes\fR and \fIno\fR; any other setting is regarded as
equivalent to the default setting.
.PP
All variable names are written in uppercase, and begin with the script
name.  Package-wide variables begin with "DEVSCRIPTS", and are listed
below, as well as in the relevant manpages.
.PP
For a list of all of the available options variables, along with their
default settings, see the example configuration file
\fI/usr/share/doc/devscripts/devscripts.conf.ex\fR.  This is copied to
\fI/etc/devscripts.conf\fR when the \fBdevscripts\fR package is first
installed.  Information about configuration options introduced in
newer versions of the package will be appended to
\fI/etc/devscripts.conf\fR when the package is upgraded.
.PP
Every script which reads the configuration files can be forced to
ignore them by using \fB\-\-no-conf\fR as the \fIfirst\fR command-line
option.
.SH "PACKAGE-WIDE VARIABLES"
The currently recognised package-wide variables are:
.TP
.BR DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL ", " DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_REGEX
These variables control scripts which change directory to find a
\fIdebian/changelog\fR file or suchlike, and some other miscellaneous
cases.  In order to prevent unwanted, even possibly dangerous,
behaviour, these variables control when actions will be performed.
The scripts which currently make use of these variables are:
\fBdebc\fR, \fBdebchange\fR/\fBdch\fR, \fBdebclean\fR, \fBdebi\fR,
\fBdebrelease\fR, \fBdebuild\fR and \fBuscan\fR, but this list may
change with time (and I may not remember to update this manpage).
Please see the manpages of individual scripts for details of the
specific behaviour for each script.
