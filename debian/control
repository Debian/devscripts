      libwww-perl, mailx]
  - checkbashisms: check whether a /bin/sh script contains any common
      bash-specific contructs
  - cvs-debi, cvs-debc: to call debi and debc from the CVS working directory
      after running cvs-debuild or cvs-buildpackage [cvs-buildpackage]
  - cvs-debrelease: to call debrelease from the CVS working directory
      after running cvs-debuild or cvs-buildpackage [cvs-buildpackage,
      dupload | dput, ssh]
  - cvs-debuild: run cvs-buildpackage using debuild (see below) as the
      package building program [cvs-buildpackage, fakeroot, lintian | linda,
      gnupg]
  - debc: display the contents of just-built .debs
  - debchange/dch: automagically add entries to debian/changelog files
      [libwww-perl]
  - debclean: purge a Debian source tree [fakeroot]
  - debdiff: compare two versions of a Debian package to check for
      added and removed files [wdiff, patchutils]
  - debi: install a just-built package
  - debpkg: dpkg wrapper to be able to manage/test packages without su
  - debrelease: wrapper around dupload or dput [dupload | dput, ssh]
  - debsign, debrsign: sign a .changes/.dsc pair without needing any of
      the rest of the package to be present; can sign the pair remotely
      or fetch the pair from a remote machine for signing [gnupg,
      debian-keyring, ssh]
  - debuild: wrapper to build a package without having to su or worry
      about how to invoke dpkg to build using fakeroot.  Also deals
      with common environment problems, umask etc. [fakeroot,
      lintian | linda, gnupg]
  - dpkg-depcheck, dpkg-genbuilddeps: determine the packages used during
      the build of a Debian package; useful for determining the Build-Depends
      control field needed [build-essential, strace]
  - dscverify: verify the integrity of a Debian package from the
      .changes or .dsc files [gnupg, debian-keyring, libdigest-md5-perl]

  - mergechanges: merge .changes files from a package built on different
      architectures
