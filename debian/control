Description: Scripts to make the life of a Debian Package maintainer easier

    E for stderr) for every line of output
  - archpath: print tla/Bazaar package names [tla | bazaar]
  - bts: a command-line tool for manipulating the BTS [www-browser,
    libwww-perl, mailx | mailutils]
  - checkbashisms: check whether a /bin/sh script contains any common
    bash-specific contructs
  - cvs-debi, cvs-debc: to call debi and debc from the CVS working directory
    after running cvs-debuild or cvs-buildpackage [cvs-buildpackage]
  - cvs-debrelease: to call debrelease from the CVS working directory
    after running cvs-debuild or cvs-buildpackage [cvs-buildpackage,
    dupload | dput, ssh]
  - cvs-debuild: run cvs-buildpackage using debuild (see below) as the
    package building program [cvs-buildpackage, fakeroot, lintian | linda,
    gnupg]
  - dd-list: given a list of packages, pretty-print it ordered by maintainer
  - debc: display the contents of just-built .debs
  - debchange/dch: automagically add entries to debian/changelog files [wget]
  - debclean: purge a Debian source tree [fakeroot]
  - debcommit: commit changes to cvs or svn, basing commit message on
    changelog [cvs | subversion]
  - debdiff: compare two versions of a Debian package to check for
    added and removed files [wdiff, patchutils]
  - debi: install a just-built package
  - debpkg: dpkg wrapper to be able to manage/test packages without su
  - debrelease: wrapper around dupload or dput [dupload | dput, ssh]
  - debsign, debrsign: sign a .changes/.dsc pair without needing any of
    the rest of the package to be present; can sign the pair remotely
    or fetch the pair from a remote machine for signing [gnupg,
    debian-keyring, ssh]
  - debuild: wrapper to build a package without having to su or worry
    about how to invoke dpkg to build using fakeroot.  Also deals
    with common environment problems, umask etc. [fakeroot,
    lintian | linda, gnupg]
  - deb-reversion: increases a binary package version number and repacks the
    archive
  - dget: downloads Debian source and binary packages [wget]
  - dpkg-depcheck, dpkg-genbuilddeps: determine the packages used during
    the build of a Debian package; useful for determining the Build-Depends
    control field needed [build-essential, strace]

  - mass-bug: mass-file bug reports [mailx | mailutils]
  - mergechanges: merge .changes files from a package built on different
    architectures

    [mailx | mailutils, at]
  - rc-alert: list installed packages which have release-critical bugs [wget]
  - rmadison: remotely query the Debian archive database about packages [wget]
  - svnpath: print svn repository paths [subversion]
  - tagpending: shell script which runs from a Debian source tree and tags
    bugs that are to be closed in the latest changelog as pending.
    [wget]
  - uscan: scan upstream sites for new releases of packages [libwww-perl]
  - uupdate: integrate upstream changes into a source package [patch]
  - whodepends: check which maintainers' packages depend on a package
  - who-uploads [gnupg, debian-keyring, wget]: determine the most recent
    uploaders of a package to the Debian archive
  - wnpp-alert: list installed packages which are orphaned or up for
    adoption [wget]
