    E for stderr) for every line of output
  - archpath: print tla/Bazaar package names [tla | bazaar]
  - bts: a command-line tool for manipulating the BTS [www-browser,
    libauthen-sasl-perl, libsoap-lite-perl, libwww-perl, mailx | mailutils]
  - build-rdeps: Searches for all packages that build-depend on a
    given package [dctrl-tools]
  - chdist: tool to easily play with several distributions [dctrl-tools]
  - checkbashisms: check whether a /bin/sh script contains any common
    bash-specific contructs
  - cvs-debi, cvs-debc: to call debi and debc from the CVS working directory
    after running cvs-debuild or cvs-buildpackage [cvs-buildpackage]
  - cvs-debrelease: to call debrelease from the CVS working directory
    after running cvs-debuild or cvs-buildpackage [cvs-buildpackage,
    dupload | dput, ssh-client]
  - cvs-debuild: run cvs-buildpackage using debuild (see below) as the
    package building program [cvs-buildpackage, fakeroot, lintian, gnupg]

  - debdiff: compare two versions of a Debian package to check for
    added and removed files [wdiff, patchutils]
