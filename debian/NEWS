devscripts (2.10.20) unstable; urgency=low

    devscripts 2.10.19 modified debcommit's --release option to use the
    uncommitted changes (if any) in the changelog to derive the commit
    message.

    This behaviour is now optional and can be enabled using the -R /
    --release-use-changelog command line option or by setting the
    DEBCOMMIT_RELEASE_USE_CHANGELOG configuration option to "yes".

    The default is to use the previous (i.e. pre-2.10.19) behaviour.

devscripts (2.10.19) unstable; urgency=low

    In devscripts 2.10.17, dget was modified to unpack source packages by
    default.  The new -d switch or the DGET_UNPACK configuration file option
    may be used to indicate that the unpacking should not occur.

    As linda has been removed from both unstable and testing, support for
    it has been removed from debuild and cvs-debuild.
