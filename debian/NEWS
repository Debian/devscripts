devscripts (2.10.19) unstable; urgency=low

    In devscripts 2.10.17, dget was modified to unpack source packages by
    default.  The new -d switch or the DGET_UNPACK configuration file option
    may be used to indicate that the unpacking should not occur.

    As linda has been removed from both unstable and testing, support for
    it has been removed from debuild and cvs-debuild.
