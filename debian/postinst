# Lists of which scripts are affected by these package-wide variables

# 
# Directory Name Checking
# 
# Several programs check the directory name and refuse to function if
# it does not match the name of the package being worked on.  (The
# details are described in the individual manpages.)
# These two variables control this behaviour, corresponding to the
# --check-dirname-level and --check-dirname-regex command line options.
# The possible values of DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL are:
#   0    never check the directory name
#   1    check the directory name only if the program has changed directory
#   2    always check the directory name
# The variable DEVSCRIPTS_DIRNAME_REGEXP is a Perl regex which
# defines what is considered a valid directory name for the source
# package PACKAGE; if it includes a '/', then it must match the full
# directory path, otherwise it must match the full directory name.
# 
# The default settings are:
# DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL=1
# DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_REGEX='PACKAGE(-.+)?'
