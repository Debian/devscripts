    + Don't bail if diff returned an exit status of 2 when comparing
      files. If there are binary files in either of the trees being compared
      then that's expected as the files can't be reliably compared.

      255 (i.e. the result of die()ing).

      comment was made. Similar functionality may be implemented in the BTS
      at a later date but in the meantime we'll avoid creating noise in the
      bug logs. (Closes: #497748)
  * checkbashisms: Flag "read without variable" and "read with options other
    than -r" separately to ensure that all uses are correctly matched. Thanks
    to Frank Lichtenheld for pointing this out via a related bug in lintian.

    than root. Patch from Cyril Brulebois. (Closes: #495536)
  * Debbugs.pm: Special-case the "archive" key in select(). The BTS really
    doesn't like it being passed as an array. (Closes: #498201)
  * debcommit:
    + When committing to a bzr repository with a message including bug
      closures, pass corresponding --fixes to bzr. Thanks James Westby
      for the patch. (Closes: #496643)
    + Fix a POD error.
  * debdiff: Add an option allowing control files in debian/ in source packages
    to be compared using wdiff.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * dpkg-depcheck: Remove -F in order to be compatible with current strace.
    I'm not sure exactly when plain 'strace -f' started being able to follow
    vfork on Linux, but it's at least as long ago as Debian 4.0, possibly
    strace 4.4.93 which would place it before Debian 3.1, so a dependency

    + Check the initial lines of shell script wrappers. Based on a patch from

    + Fix a couple of the quoted block detection checks so as not to trigger
      on escaped quotes and correctly count quotes within lines containing ''

    + Only rebuild the lists of expressions to search for when required,
      rather than for each line of each file
    + Disable "makefile mode" after checking a makefile if the next file to
      check isn't a makefile
    + Several enhancements to heredoc detection:
      - Heredoc delimiters may contain "non word" characters if the delimiter
        is quoted. As a side-effect, delimiters which match one of the bashism
        expressions may now be flagged due to the order in which checks are
        performed.
      - SUS specifies that a heredoc ends on a line consisting solely of a
        delimiter, so we enforce that and also don't check such lines.
      - Delimiters may now contain regular expression meta-characters.

      does not currently support them. (Closes: #476100)

    + Fix an unescaped hyphen in the manpage
    + If starting a changelog stanza for a new maintainer upload with
      the distribution set to UNRELEASED, check whether the previous
      stanza is also UNRELEASED and, if so, merge them (assuming the 
      "changelog" release heuristic is in use) (Closes: #458130)
    + Add non-maintainer uploads (including security and QA uploads),
      backports and the use of local version strings to the list of
      cases where debchange doesn't have to guess the user's intentions
    + Add an --allow-lower-version option which is similar to
      --force-bad-version but allows a regular expression to be specified
      which the new version must match. Based on a patch by Frank Küster

      be XSIisms etc rather than strictly bash-specific features

    + Fix an unescaped hyphen in the manpage
    + Add a check for function names containing characters other than
      alphanumerics and underscore

      than -r. Thanks Luca Capello (Closes: #470696)
    + Add an option to allow flagging of lines which do not contain bashisms
      but which may contain other useful information - for example, checking
      whether $BASH is set before using bashisms or $RANDOM being used as a
      local variable rather than the bash built-in variable (Closes: #470999)
    + Add a check for "VAR+=foo" (Closes: #471001)

      used, use them as the commit message. Otherwise use the message passed
      with --message or "releasing version X.Y" as currently
      (Closes: #470366)
    + Format commit messages in a more useful manner for git and hg. The
      first change found is unfolded and used as the summary line. If more
      than one change was found then an editor is spawned so that the message
      can be fine-tuned if required (Closes: #402531)

  * debchange.pl: Don't check for -w 'debian/changelog', check whether
    we're in debian/ first, to avoid false positives. (Closes: #264310)

    mail(1) to send the control email, but toss it all to bts.pl which will

devscripts (2.7.93) unstable; urgency=low

  * New scripts:
    - cvs-debuild: wrapper for debuild to use cvs-buildpackage, or for
                   cvs-buildpackage to use debuild (closes: #36344 at last!)
    - cvs-debi, cvs-debc: wrapper for debi, debc to use in conjunction
                   with cvs-debuild or cvs-buildpackage; function like
                   debi and debc, but are run from the CVS working
                   directory instead (also in #36344)
    - rc-alert:    list all installed packages which appear in the
                   list of packages with RC bugs
    - wnpp-alert:  list all installed packages which appear in the WNPP
                   orphaned or up-for-adoption lists (closes: #188246)
  * lots of scripts: remove --ignore-dirname option and provide
    --check-dirname-level and --check-dirname-regex along with
    configuration file options to set the default directory name-checking
    behaviour (closes: #218153)
  * lots of scripts: provide --no-conf/--noconf option for all scripts
    which read the devscripts configuration files, and provide useful
    information when the --help option is used (closes: #218224)
  * bts: identify itself in its automatic emails (closes: #199312)
  * bts: dangerous "no-option" behaviour to cleancache changed
  * bts: completely rewrite the caching system using LWP, based on an idea
    gleaned from the original rc-alert together with knowledge of the BTS
    internals ;-); this does give a couple of minor disadvantages, but
    lots of major advantages too (the code is *much* cleaner now, and we
    only need to store each page once!); there is still a slightly messy
    converter to convert the old cache to the new format, but that shall
    go away soonish (probably after 2-3 months or sarge release, whichever
    is sooner), to be replaced with a simple warning
  * bts: support "bts bugs tag:<tag>" (closes: #218494)
  * bts: deprecate "bts close" command, following the lead of debbugs
  * accept EMAIL as well as DEBEMAIL (closes: #219127)
  * debi, debc: rewrote in Perl (there was so much Perl embedded, it
    didn't make sense to leave it in shell script)
  * debi, debc: provide --no-conf option
  * debc/debi: support only listing/installing specified packages (closes:
    #200372)
  * debchange: improve regex to recognise more successful uploads (closes:
    #218242)

    #211031)

  * debuild: fix command line parsing (uploaded this one as 2.7.92.1)
    (closed #218108, #218234)
  * debuild: more command-line parsing stuff (closes: #218379, #220900)
  * debuild: pass -e<maint> option to debsign (oops!)
  * debuild: deprecate -E option (dpkg-buildpackage now uses it); so only
    -e and -r short options are left
  * debuild: deprecate -L/--lintian option for indicating lintian options,
    replace with --lintian-opts
  * debuild: support linda (closes: #178456)
  * debuild: now always recognises -d/-D options to skip/force use of
    dpkg-checkbuilddeps (closes: #188216)
  * grep-excuses: converted to use wget and caching instead of libwww-perl
    (faster)
  * plotchangelog: provided --cumulative option
  * devscripts.conf.5: new manpage (closes: #217858)
  * removed the dummy build, release and signchanges scripts (they were
    renamed over four years ago)
  * updated the devscripts.conf default file to add new programs to the
    list
  * note that it's really sourced by /bin/bash. not generic /bin/sh (and
    modify the rest of the package accordingly); this cleans up a minor
    inconsistency
  * place symlink to the default config file in doc directory
  * improved tempfile security in plotchangelogs, debdiff, grep-excuses

    made that mistake in as many days...) (closes: #50549)
  * Added a simple debian-test script to check that I get the version
    numbering right....
  * Added build dependecies (which wasn't really that hard...)
  * Correct debdiff problem: forgot to chdir back after looking at first
    changes file
  * debit now runs debian-test *without* su nobody; I believe that it is
    the responsibility of the test programs themselves to handle choosing
    their userid
  * Correct handling of .changes file entries when package is in
    non-US/main/libs or suchlike (really closes: #50281)

devscripts (2.5.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add -m option to deb(r)sign to parallel the behaviour of
    dpkg-buildpackage; this is obviously desirable, and necessary to
  * make sure that debuild pays attention to any -m, -k, -p or -s options
    given to dpkg-buildpackage when calling debsign (should close #50281),
    and
  * make debsign sign the right .changes file!  (closes: #50134)
  * Teach debdiff to fully handle potato version of dpkg -c output
  * Make debdiff able to handle .changes files as well as just single .deb
    files
  * Make debdiff Perl more idiomatic

    file (closes: #33699)

    I should have done when correcting bug #43082)
  * Add Joey's plotchangelog program (closes: #50150)

  * Add --version and --help options to all programs (and this effectively

  * Add long options to all programs except for deb(r)sign, as the options
    there match those in dpkg-buildpackage (closes: #41850)
  * No longer suggest PGP, as GNU Privacy Guard with the requisite
    extensions should be sufficient
  * Correct debdiff to take account of new format of dpkg-deb -c output
    (and why did it change?)
  * Make sure debian/rules clean really does that (error in Makefile.am)
  * Rewrite of internals of debuild in several places, especially with
    regard to -r handling.  Much nicer logic now.

devscripts (2.1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now only Suggests: rather than Recommend: perl-suid (closes: #35635)
  * Added Roderick's patch to dscverify, and added a change directory
    feature of my own: a .changes file may be in any directory, and the
    program will cd to that directory before trying to read any files
    (closes: #34255)
  * Added a rewritten, Perl version, of Yann Dirson's debdiff script
    (closes: #34781)

devscripts (2.1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Correct README to refer to libtricks package rather than fakeroot
    package (closes: #32736)
  * Modify uupdate to accept a -u argument to keep an Upstream pristine
    source (closes: #32680, #12443); bump up the minor version number for
    this
  * A few other miscellaneous bug fixes to uupdate to be stricter about
    seeming problems
  * Added a new program: signchanges for signing a .changes/.dsc pair
    without needing any of the rest of the source or binary files to be
    present; this is useful for when a developer must build a package on
    a machine other than the one on which he is signing

 -- Julian Gilbey <jdg@debian.org>  Wed,  3 Feb 1999 02:31:15 +0000

devscripts (2.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use the TMPDIR environment variable instead of /tmp if it is set
    (requested by Zephaniah E, Hull)

 -- Julian Gilbey <jdg@debian.org>  Thu,  7 Jan 1999 21:56:11 +0000

devscripts (2.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer
  * Standards: 2.5.0.0
  * New version numbering scheme: major.minor.patchlevel
  * Changed the name of build to debuild.  build now just prints an error
    message and will disappear completely in the near future.
  * Correct handling of epochs in debc, debi and release (closes: #29855)
  * Use environment variables EDITOR, then VISUAL, and failing that,
    /usr/bin/editor in accordance with policy 5.3 (except that VISUAL is
    not mentioned there)  (closes: #28605)
  * Many modifications to uscan: it now compares version numbers
    correctly, using a Perl script which works in a similar way to
    dpkg --compare-versions, and it no longer has the extra 0 bug
    (closes: #19235, #19467); it no longer uses ncftp but only ftp
    (closes: #20968)
  * uscan now expects the watch file to explicitly indicate how to deduce
    the version number from the filename, by writing the filename as a
    Perl regular expression and enclosing the version number part in (...)
  * uupdate now allows a version number as an argument after the archive
    filename, allowing it to work in harmony with uscan (closes: #20278)
  * uupdate no longer tries to remove *.orig files, as the only ones which
    are created by GNU patch are those where the patch failed, and we
    probably _want_ to keep those (closes: #25774)
  * build rewritten in Perl (now called debuild); has a nicer handling of
    command line options (can accept a -r option with one of binary etc.,
    and doesn't need an explicit -r option if there are other
    dpkg-buildpackage options)  (closes: #27752)
  * debpkg rewritten in Perl as well
  * This package is now an Architecture: all package as there are no
    binaries left
  * debchange now uses the last distributions mentioned in the changelog
    as the default for the new version (closes: #30204)
  * debchange now uses the environment variables DEBFULLNAME and EMAIL as
    the uploader's details if these are set
  * release has been deprecated in favour of dupload, and now just prints
    a message suggesting the use of dupload instead (Closes: #29826,
    #29978)
  * The debchange command line options have been changed.  debchange no
    longer pays attention to the presence of a RELEASED file.  The -i
    option is for Increasing the Debian release number; the -a option is
    for Appending to the current version, and the -v option specifies a
    specific version number.  One of these is mandatory
  * Debchange now adds new changelog entries to the END of the current
    section, rather than the beginning
  * Improved logic of upgrading the Debian release number in debchange
  * Debchange does not supply a release number if there is an explicit
    version number provided
  * Now debchange works on a version of the changelog in /tmp and only
    overwrites the current changelog if everything is OK; this is much
    safer than the original version.  Also, all system calls have their
    return status checked
  * release and build now print error messages suggesting their
    replacements
  * debuild now runs lintian by default if it is installed; there is an
    override facility etc., as described in the manpage (Closes: #18254)
  * Added Roderick Schertler's dscverify program to devscripts
  * Rewrote many bits of many man pages
  * debian/rules and Makefile modified to use debhelper
