    strace 4.4.93 which would place it before Debian 3.1, so a dependency
    doesn't seem to be necessary. (Closes: #497955)

    + Disable "makefile mode" after checking a makefile if the next file to

    + Several enhancements to heredoc detection:
      - Heredoc delimiters may contain "non word" characters if the delimiter
        is quoted. As a side-effect, delimiters which match one of the bashism
        expressions may now be flagged due to the order in which checks are
        performed.
      - SUS specifies that a heredoc ends on a line consisting solely of a

    + Fix an unescaped hyphen in the manpage
    + If starting a changelog stanza for a new maintainer upload with
      the distribution set to UNRELEASED, check whether the previous
      stanza is also UNRELEASED and, if so, merge them (assuming the
      "changelog" release heuristic is in use) (Closes: #458130)
    + Add non-maintainer uploads (including security and QA uploads),
      backports and the use of local version strings to the list of
      cases where debchange doesn't have to guess the user's intentions
    + Add an --allow-lower-version option which is similar to
      --force-bad-version but allows a regular expression to be specified
      which the new version must match. Based on a patch by Frank Küster

      be XSIisms etc rather than strictly bash-specific features
    + Add checks for suspend, caller, complete/compgen, declare/typeset,
      disown, builtin, set -[BHT], alias -p, unalias -a, local with

    + Fix an unescaped hyphen in the manpage
    + Add a check for function names containing characters other than
      alphanumerics and underscore

      than -r. Thanks Luca Capello (Closes: #470696)
    + Add an option to allow flagging of lines which do not contain bashisms
      but which may contain other useful information - for example, checking
      whether $BASH is set before using bashisms or $RANDOM being used as a
      local variable rather than the bash built-in variable (Closes: #470999)
    + Add a check for "VAR+=foo" (Closes: #471001)

    + If there are uncommitted changes to the changelog when --release is
      used, use them as the commit message. Otherwise use the message passed
      with --message or "releasing version X.Y" as currently
      (Closes: #470366)
    + Format commit messages in a more useful manner for git and hg. The
      first change found is unfolded and used as the summary line. If more
      than one change was found then an editor is spawned so that the message
      can be fine-tuned if required (Closes: #402531)

    + Skip arguments to select() that contain valid keys but not values
    + Print a warning about unrecognised keys passed to select()
    + Add on_fault handlers to SOAP calls so we can return useful error
      messages
  * debuild:

devscripts (2.7.93) unstable; urgency=low

  * New scripts:
    - cvs-debuild: wrapper for debuild to use cvs-buildpackage, or for
                   cvs-buildpackage to use debuild (closes: #36344 at last!)
    - cvs-debi, cvs-debc: wrapper for debi, debc to use in conjunction
                   with cvs-debuild or cvs-buildpackage; function like
                   debi and debc, but are run from the CVS working
                   directory instead (also in #36344)
    - rc-alert:    list all installed packages which appear in the
                   list of packages with RC bugs
    - wnpp-alert:  list all installed packages which appear in the WNPP
                   orphaned or up-for-adoption lists (closes: #188246)
  * lots of scripts: remove --ignore-dirname option and provide
    --check-dirname-level and --check-dirname-regex along with
    configuration file options to set the default directory name-checking
    behaviour (closes: #218153)
  * lots of scripts: provide --no-conf/--noconf option for all scripts
    which read the devscripts configuration files, and provide useful
    information when the --help option is used (closes: #218224)
  * bts: identify itself in its automatic emails (closes: #199312)
  * bts: dangerous "no-option" behaviour to cleancache changed
  * bts: completely rewrite the caching system using LWP, based on an idea
    gleaned from the original rc-alert together with knowledge of the BTS
    internals ;-); this does give a couple of minor disadvantages, but
    lots of major advantages too (the code is *much* cleaner now, and we
    only need to store each page once!); there is still a slightly messy
    converter to convert the old cache to the new format, but that shall
    go away soonish (probably after 2-3 months or sarge release, whichever
    is sooner), to be replaced with a simple warning
  * bts: support "bts bugs tag:<tag>" (closes: #218494)
  * bts: deprecate "bts close" command, following the lead of debbugs
  * accept EMAIL as well as DEBEMAIL (closes: #219127)
  * debi, debc: rewrote in Perl (there was so much Perl embedded, it
    didn't make sense to leave it in shell script)
  * debi, debc: provide --no-conf option
  * debc/debi: support only listing/installing specified packages (closes:
    #200372)
  * debchange: improve regex to recognise more successful uploads (closes:
    #218242)
  * debchange: perform various UTF-8 checks (closes: #218785)

    #211031)

    (closed #218108, #218234)
  * debuild: more command-line parsing stuff (closes: #218379, #220900)
  * debuild: pass -e<maint> option to debsign (oops!)
  * debuild: deprecate -E option (dpkg-buildpackage now uses it); so only
    -e and -r short options are left
  * debuild: deprecate -L/--lintian option for indicating lintian options,
    replace with --lintian-opts
  * debuild: support linda (closes: #178456)
  * debuild: now always recognises -d/-D options to skip/force use of
    dpkg-checkbuilddeps (closes: #188216)
  * grep-excuses: converted to use wget and caching instead of libwww-perl
    (faster)
  * plotchangelog: provided --cumulative option
  * devscripts.conf.5: new manpage (closes: #217858)
  * removed the dummy build, release and signchanges scripts (they were
    renamed over four years ago)
  * updated the devscripts.conf default file to add new programs to the
    list
  * note that it's really sourced by /bin/bash. not generic /bin/sh (and
    modify the rest of the package accordingly); this cleans up a minor
    inconsistency
  * place symlink to the default config file in doc directory
  * improved tempfile security in plotchangelogs, debdiff, grep-excuses

  * Added build dependecies (which wasn't really that hard...)

  * Make debdiff able to handle .changes files as well as just single .deb
    files

  * No longer suggest PGP, as GNU Privacy Guard with the requisite
    extensions should be sufficient
  * Correct debdiff to take account of new format of dpkg-deb -c output
    (and why did it change?)
  * Make sure debian/rules clean really does that (error in Makefile.am)
  * Rewrite of internals of debuild in several places, especially with
    regard to -r handling.  Much nicer logic now.

devscripts (2.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer
  * Standards: 2.5.0.0
  * New version numbering scheme: major.minor.patchlevel
  * Changed the name of build to debuild.  build now just prints an error
    message and will disappear completely in the near future.
  * Correct handling of epochs in debc, debi and release (closes: #29855)
  * Use environment variables EDITOR, then VISUAL, and failing that,
    /usr/bin/editor in accordance with policy 5.3 (except that VISUAL is
    not mentioned there)  (closes: #28605)
  * Many modifications to uscan: it now compares version numbers
    correctly, using a Perl script which works in a similar way to
    dpkg --compare-versions, and it no longer has the extra 0 bug
    (closes: #19235, #19467); it no longer uses ncftp but only ftp
    (closes: #20968)
  * uscan now expects the watch file to explicitly indicate how to deduce
    the version number from the filename, by writing the filename as a
    Perl regular expression and enclosing the version number part in (...)
  * uupdate now allows a version number as an argument after the archive
    filename, allowing it to work in harmony with uscan (closes: #20278)
  * uupdate no longer tries to remove *.orig files, as the only ones which
    are created by GNU patch are those where the patch failed, and we
    probably _want_ to keep those (closes: #25774)
  * build rewritten in Perl (now called debuild); has a nicer handling of
    command line options (can accept a -r option with one of binary etc.,
    and doesn't need an explicit -r option if there are other
    dpkg-buildpackage options)  (closes: #27752)
  * debpkg rewritten in Perl as well
  * This package is now an Architecture: all package as there are no
    binaries left
  * debchange now uses the last distributions mentioned in the changelog
    as the default for the new version (closes: #30204)
  * debchange now uses the environment variables DEBFULLNAME and EMAIL as
    the uploader's details if these are set
  * release has been deprecated in favour of dupload, and now just prints
    a message suggesting the use of dupload instead (Closes: #29826,
    #29978)
  * The debchange command line options have been changed.  debchange no
    longer pays attention to the presence of a RELEASED file.  The -i
    option is for Increasing the Debian release number; the -a option is
    for Appending to the current version, and the -v option specifies a
    specific version number.  One of these is mandatory
  * Debchange now adds new changelog entries to the END of the current
    section, rather than the beginning
  * Improved logic of upgrading the Debian release number in debchange
  * Debchange does not supply a release number if there is an explicit
    version number provided
  * Now debchange works on a version of the changelog in /tmp and only
    overwrites the current changelog if everything is OK; this is much
    safer than the original version.  Also, all system calls have their
    return status checked
  * release and build now print error messages suggesting their
    replacements
  * debuild now runs lintian by default if it is installed; there is an
    override facility etc., as described in the manpage (Closes: #18254)
  * Added Roderick Schertler's dscverify program to devscripts
  * Rewrote many bits of many man pages
  * debian/rules and Makefile modified to use debhelper
