  * debchange: Add --release-heuristic and DEBCHANGE_RELEASE_HEURISTIC
    options to control how it tells if a package was released.
  * debchange: Add new "changelog" release heuristic, which looks
    for a distribution of "UNRELEASED" in a changelog (and adds such a
    distribution by default when making new entries). Useful for packages
    maintained/released by multiple people.

      newer versions regardless (closes: #260538)
    - uscan: handle metacharacters in directory components (closes: #262489)

      pretty much what was requested) (closes: #143284)

    - tagpending: fix -n output message (closes: #269125)
    - tagpending: give progress output; introduce silent option
    - uscan: support version numbers with ~ (change Devscripts::Versort to
      simply call dpkg --compare-versions to do the work) (closes: #232286)
    - wnpp-alert: now correctly reports on orphaned packages as well
      (tweaked some sed scripts; don't know what was actually wrong :-/ )
      (closes: #268948)
  * Joshua Kwan
    - debrsign: Warn if you passed a changes file but omitted the remote
      address.
    - Update debchange and tagpending for new bts2ldap gateway.
    - Remove ${perl:Depends} from control file, dh_perl is not guessing that
      we do actually need 5.8, and so we end up with a perl (>= 5.8), perl
      dependency, which is wrong.

    - cvs-debi, cvs-debc: wrapper for debi, debc to use in conjunction
                   with cvs-debuild or cvs-buildpackage; function like
                   debi and debc, but are run from the CVS working
                   directory instead (also in #36344)
    - rc-alert:    list all installed packages which appear in the
                   list of packages with RC bugs

                   orphaned or up-for-adoption lists (closes: #188246)

    --check-dirname-level and --check-dirname-regex along with
    configuration file options to set the default directory name-checking
    behaviour (closes: #218153)
  * lots of scripts: provide --no-conf/--noconf option for all scripts
    which read the devscripts configuration files, and provide useful
    information when the --help option is used (closes: #218224)
  * bts: identify itself in its automatic emails (closes: #199312)
  * bts: dangerous "no-option" behaviour to cleancache changed
  * bts: completely rewrite the caching system using LWP, based on an idea
    gleaned from the original rc-alert together with knowledge of the BTS
    internals ;-); this does give a couple of minor disadvantages, but
    lots of major advantages too (the code is *much* cleaner now, and we
    only need to store each page once!); there is still a slightly messy
    converter to convert the old cache to the new format, but that shall
    go away soonish (probably after 2-3 months or sarge release, whichever
    is sooner), to be replaced with a simple warning
  * bts: support "bts bugs tag:<tag>" (closes: #218494)
  * bts: deprecate "bts close" command, following the lead of debbugs
  * accept EMAIL as well as DEBEMAIL (closes: #219127)

    didn't make sense to leave it in shell script)

    #200372)

  * debuild: more command-line parsing stuff (closes: #218379, #220900)
  * debuild: pass -e<maint> option to debsign (oops!)
  * debuild: deprecate -E option (dpkg-buildpackage now uses it); so only
    -e and -r short options are left
  * debuild: deprecate -L/--lintian option for indicating lintian options,
    replace with --lintian-opts
  * debuild: support linda (closes: #178456)
  * debuild: now always recognises -d/-D options to skip/force use of
    dpkg-checkbuilddeps (closes: #188216)
  * grep-excuses: converted to use wget and caching instead of libwww-perl
    (faster)
  * plotchangelog: provided --cumulative option
  * devscripts.conf.5: new manpage (closes: #217858)
  * removed the dummy build, release and signchanges scripts (they were
    renamed over four years ago)
  * updated the devscripts.conf default file to add new programs to the
    list
  * note that it's really sourced by /bin/bash. not generic /bin/sh (and
    modify the rest of the package accordingly); this cleans up a minor
    inconsistency
  * place symlink to the default config file in doc directory
  * improved tempfile security in plotchangelogs, debdiff, grep-excuses

    given to dpkg-buildpackage when calling debsign (should close #50281),
    and
  * make debsign sign the right .changes file!  (closes: #50134)
  * Teach debdiff to fully handle potato version of dpkg -c output
  * Make debdiff able to handle .changes files as well as just single .deb
    files
  * Make debdiff Perl more idiomatic
  * Allow deb[ic] to handle multiple binary packages by parsing .changes
    file (closes: #33699)
  * Merged deb[ic] into one file, as their functionality is almost
    identical
  * Corrected a few more occurrences of manually parsing changelogs (which
    I should have done when correcting bug #43082)
  * Add Joey's plotchangelog program (closes: #50150)
  * Added a README.i18n file
  * Added James R. Van Zandt's debit script, merged into a single script
    with debi.

    package (closes: #32736)

    seeming problems
  * Added a new program: signchanges for signing a .changes/.dsc pair
    without needing any of the rest of the source or binary files to be
    present; this is useful for when a developer must build a package on
    a machine other than the one on which he is signing

devscripts (2.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer
  * Standards: 2.5.0.0
  * New version numbering scheme: major.minor.patchlevel
  * Changed the name of build to debuild.  build now just prints an error
    message and will disappear completely in the near future.
  * Correct handling of epochs in debc, debi and release (closes: #29855)
  * Use environment variables EDITOR, then VISUAL, and failing that,
    /usr/bin/editor in accordance with policy 5.3 (except that VISUAL is
    not mentioned there)  (closes: #28605)
  * Many modifications to uscan: it now compares version numbers
    correctly, using a Perl script which works in a similar way to
    dpkg --compare-versions, and it no longer has the extra 0 bug
    (closes: #19235, #19467); it no longer uses ncftp but only ftp
    (closes: #20968)
  * uscan now expects the watch file to explicitly indicate how to deduce
    the version number from the filename, by writing the filename as a
    Perl regular expression and enclosing the version number part in (...)
  * uupdate now allows a version number as an argument after the archive
    filename, allowing it to work in harmony with uscan (closes: #20278)
  * uupdate no longer tries to remove *.orig files, as the only ones which
    are created by GNU patch are those where the patch failed, and we
    probably _want_ to keep those (closes: #25774)
  * build rewritten in Perl (now called debuild); has a nicer handling of
    command line options (can accept a -r option with one of binary etc.,
    and doesn't need an explicit -r option if there are other
    dpkg-buildpackage options)  (closes: #27752)
  * debpkg rewritten in Perl as well
  * This package is now an Architecture: all package as there are no
    binaries left
  * debchange now uses the last distributions mentioned in the changelog
    as the default for the new version (closes: #30204)
  * debchange now uses the environment variables DEBFULLNAME and EMAIL as
    the uploader's details if these are set
  * release has been deprecated in favour of dupload, and now just prints
    a message suggesting the use of dupload instead (Closes: #29826,
    #29978)
  * The debchange command line options have been changed.  debchange no
    longer pays attention to the presence of a RELEASED file.  The -i
    option is for Increasing the Debian release number; the -a option is
    for Appending to the current version, and the -v option specifies a
    specific version number.  One of these is mandatory
  * Debchange now adds new changelog entries to the END of the current
    section, rather than the beginning
  * Improved logic of upgrading the Debian release number in debchange
  * Debchange does not supply a release number if there is an explicit
    version number provided
  * Now debchange works on a version of the changelog in /tmp and only
    overwrites the current changelog if everything is OK; this is much
    safer than the original version.  Also, all system calls have their
    return status checked
  * release and build now print error messages suggesting their
    replacements
  * debuild now runs lintian by default if it is installed; there is an
    override facility etc., as described in the manpage (Closes: #18254)
  * Added Roderick Schertler's dscverify program to devscripts
  * Rewrote many bits of many man pages
  * debian/rules and Makefile modified to use debhelper
