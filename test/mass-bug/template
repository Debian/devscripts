#PACKAGE# has a bug. Please fix.

This long line gets word-wrapped because text/plain; format=flowed never really took off.

These short lines
also get
wrapped.

#PACKAGE# version=#VERSION#

#PACKAGE# epoch=#EPOCH#

#PACKAGE# upstream=#UPSTREAM_VERSION#

#PACKAGE# revision=#REVISION#

#PACKAGE# reassembled=#EPOCH##UPSTREAM_VERSION##REVISION#

-- 
This signature does not get word-wrapped because it is a signature, even though it is longer than a line ought to be.
