List of things to do when adding a new script to devscripts package:

1. Add the script under scripts/
   - the script should have .sh or .pl extension, otherwise have a look at
     scripts/Makefile and patch it
   - if the script is perl and uses embedded POD for documentation, add an
     entry to the GEN_MAN1S variable in Makefile
2. Add an entry in README
3. Add an entry in debian/control
4. Add an entry in po4a/devscripts-po4a.conf
5. Add any necessary entries to the Suggests: and Recommends: lines in
   debian/control
6. Modify conf.default.in and debian/postinst if necessary
7. Modify debian/copyright if necessary
8. Add entries in .gitignore
9. Add a changelog entry
