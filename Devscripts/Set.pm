=head1 NAME

Devscripts::Set - Functions for handling sets.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use Devscripts::Set;

@set=ListToSet(@list);

@setdiff=SetMinus(\@set1,\@set2);

@setinter=SetInter(\@set1,\@set2);

@setunion=SetUnion(\@set1,\@set2);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

ListToSet: Make a set (array with duplicates removed) from a list of
items given by an array.

SetMinus, SetInter, SetUnion: Compute the set theoretic difference,
intersection, union of two sets given as arrays.

# Transforms a list to a set, removing duplicates
# input:  list
# output: set

sub ListToSet (@)
{
    my %items;

    grep $items{$_}++, @_;

    return keys %items;
}


# Compute the set-theoretic difference of two sets.
# input: ref to Set 1, ref to Set 2
# output: set

sub SetMinus ($$)
{
    my ($set1,$set2)=@_;
    my %items;

    return grep $items{$_}>0, keys %items;
}


# Compute the set-theoretic intersection of two sets.
# input: ref to Set 1, ref to Set 2
# output: set

    return grep $items{$_}==2, keys %items;
}


#Compute the set-theoretic union of two sets.
#input: ref to Set 1, ref to Set 2
#output: set
