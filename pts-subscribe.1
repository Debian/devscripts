.SH NAME
pts-subscribe \- time-limited subscription to the PTS
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpts-subscribe\fR [options] \fIpackage\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpts-subscribe\fR sends a subscription request for the package
\fIpackage\fR to the Package Tracking System at pts@qa.debian.org, and
schedules an unsubscription request for a future date using
\fBat\fR(1), by default in 30 days' time.  This can be changed either
using the configuration files (see below) or command-line options.
.PP
This utility is useful if a developer has made an NMU and wants to
track the package thereafter for a limited period of time.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-until \fItime\fR, \fB\-u\fR \fItime\fR
When \fBat\fR(1) should send the unsubscription request, using
\fBat\fR's syntax.  Default is 'now + 30 days'.  This option will
probably require quoting!  \fB\-\-until forever\fR is equivalent to
using the \fB\-\-forever\fR option.
.TP
.B \-\-forever
Don't send an automatic unsubscribe request.
.TP
.BR \-\-help ", " \-h
Display a help message and exit successfully.
.TP
.B \-\-version
Display version and copyright information and exit successfully.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.TP
.BR DEBEMAIL ", " EMAIL
If one of these is set (with preference give to DEBEMAIL), then this
will be used for the subscription address.  If neither is set, then
the email will be sent without a specified subscription address, and
the email's From: line will be used to determine the sender's
address.  This will be determined by \fBmail\fR(1).
.SH "CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
The two configuration files \fI/etc/devscripts.conf\fR and
\fI~/.devscripts\fR are sourced in that order to set configuration
variables.  Command line options can be used to override configuration
file settings.  Environment variable settings are ignored for this
purpose.  The currently recognised variables are:
.TP
.B PTS_UNTIL
Setting this is equivalent to giving a \fB\-\-until\fR option.
