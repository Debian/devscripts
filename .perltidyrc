-bbao           # put line breaks before any operator
-nbbc           # don't force blank lines before comments (bad for else blocks)
-ce             # cuddle braces around else
-l=79           # usually use 78, but don't want 79-long lines reformatted
-pt=2           # don't add extra whitespace around parentheses
-sbt=2          # ...or square brackets
-sfs            # no space before semicolon in for (not that I use this form)
-bar            # opening-brace-always-on-right
-sot            # avoid lines with isolated opening tokens
-sct            # ... same for closing tokens
-fs             # allow "perltidy, please don't touch this" sections
