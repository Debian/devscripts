.TH ANNOTATE 1 "Debian Utilities" "DEBIAN" \" -*- nroff -*-
.SH NAME
annotate \- annotate program output with time and stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBannotate\fR \fIprogram\fR [\fIargs\fR ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBannotate\fR will execute the specified program, while prepending
every line with the current time and O for stdout and E for stderr.

.SH EXAMPLE

.nf
$ annotate make
21:41:21 I: Started make
21:41:21 O: gcc -Wall program.c
21:43:18 E: program.c: Couldn't compile, and took me ages to find out
21:43:19 E: collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
21:43:19 E: make: *** [all] Error 1
21:43:19 I: Finished with exitcode 2
.fi

.SH BUGS and known limitations
Since stdout and stderr are processed in parallel, it can happen that some
lines received on stdout will show up before later-printed stderr lines (and
vice-versa).
This is unfortunately very hard to fix with the current annotate strategy.  A
fix would involve switching to PTRACE'ing the process.  Giving nice a (much)
higher priority over the executed program could however cause this behaviour
to show up less frequently.

Works not so well when output is not linewise. Especially, when an interactive
program asks for input, the question might not be shown until after you have
answered it. This will give the impressing the annotated program hangs, while
it isn't.

Annotate does not accept any command-line options, so also --help, --version,
and that kind of stuff is not going to work (unless you install
/usr/bin/--help ;) )

.SH TODO
Accept --help, --version, err on any other option-line parameter.

Get rich with this very sophisticated piece of bash.
