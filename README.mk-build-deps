@packagename@ for Debian


This package has the sole purpose of installing packages required for
building the Debian package indicated by its name; it does so by
depending on these packages:

@depends@

It was generated by the mk-build-deps program from the information in
the Build-Depends field(s) of the source package.

@packagename@ can be safely removed after the package it was created for
is built.  If that breaks anything, a dependency is missing in the
package's Depends field.
