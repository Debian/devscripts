.SH NAME
nmudiff \- email an NMU diff to the Debian BTS
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBnmudiff\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBnmudiff\fR should be run in the source tree of the package being NMUed,
after the NMU is built. It assumes that the source for the previous version
of the package as well as the newly built version are in the directory
below, and uses \fBdebdiff\fR to generate a NMU diff. It then runs an editor
so that the diff can be examined and modified; once you exit the editor the
diff will be mailed to the Debian BTS.
